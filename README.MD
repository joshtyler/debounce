# Debounce

A VHDL core to debounce an input.

This core can debounce an input when provided with:
1. A sampling clock.
2. The sampling clock frequency
3. The required settling time.

##Testing and Issues
The VHDL core has verified in simulation with a simple testbench. Validation testing will be be provided shortly using an example FPGA implementation.

There are no known issues at present.

##Documentation
Documentation will be added shortly.

##License
This project is released under the MIT license, see LICENSE.txt.
